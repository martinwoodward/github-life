When adding new functionality, make sure you suggest changes that will update the README.md. This will help users understand the new features and how to use them. 

If adding a new file and bringing existing code over, ensure that the methods are fully implemented.

Ensure new code added is well documented to make it easy to understand and follows the existing code style.
